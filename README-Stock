Stock Class:

How To Instantiate:

Stock name = new Stock( "ticker of stock" );

Key Methods:

update() - BY FAR MOST IMPORTANT METHOD!!! Nothing will be correct without this method, this method pulls data from
		yahoo finance so that the data is correct and up to date.

getAbv() - will return a string containing the ticker.
getAsk() - will return a double containing the current ask for the stock.
getBid() - will return a double containing the current bid for the stock.
getOpen() - will return a double containing the current open of the stock.
getDivYield() - will return a double containing the current dividend yield of the stock.
getPrevClose() - will return a double containing the previous close of the stock.

Errors:

If you ever get an error from the code refering to the website, as long as the ticker is correct this just means that 
yahoo finance blocked the program from accessing the website for whatever reason. Just run it again and it should be 
fine.
